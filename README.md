📊 Analysis of over 6,000 insurance claims (~£68M) to detect fraud, assess processing efficiency &amp; agent activity. Features interactive dashboards, fraud intelligence reports, and a Random Forest risk scoring model. 🚀 Goal: enable faster investigations, early fraud detection &amp; smarter claims handling.

**Project Description**- This project analyzes over 6,000 insurance claims (~£68M) to uncover fraud risks and inefficiencies.
It delivers interactive dashboards, fraud intelligence reports, and a risk scoring model.
The goal: enable faster investigations, early fraud detection, and smarter claims handling.

**Project Rationale**- Insurance claims processes face challenges from fraud, long handling times, and inconsistent agent oversight.
By analyzing over 6,000 claims, this project identifies patterns in fraud risk, processing delays, and regional/agent behaviors.
The rationale is to use data-driven insights to strengthen fraud prevention, improve efficiency, and enhance customer trust.

**Project Overview**- This project focuses on analyzing over 6,000 insurance claims worth ~£68M to uncover key trends and risks.
It applies data analytics, visualization, and machine learning to detect fraud, monitor agent activity, and assess processing efficiency.
The outcome is a Fraud Intelligence Report and dashboards that support faster, fairer, and more accurate claims handling.

**Project Aim-** The aim of this project is to analyze insurance claims data to identify fraud risks, inefficiencies, and patterns in agent and customer behavior.
It seeks to apply data visualization and predictive modeling to enhance transparency and decision-making in claims handling.
Ultimately, the project aims to support faster investigations, early fraud detection, and improved customer trust.

**Project Scope**- This project covers the analysis of over 6,000 insurance claims (68M), focusing on fraud detection, claim processing efficiency, customer tenure patterns, and agent activity.
It includes data exploration, interactive dashboards, fraud intelligence reporting, and a machine learning risk scoring model to guide decision-making and process improvements.
